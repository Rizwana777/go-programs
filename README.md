1. Interfaces are named collection of method signatures
   - Common functions of a character can be defined in interfaces and any number of characters can use that interface. for eg, a person can walk or    talk so here walk and talk are the functions which we defined in interface and any number of characters can use this interface.
   - We can make sure our functions are following set of instructions that we want them to follow by using interfaces.
